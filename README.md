# R Data Structures and Algorithms
<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/r-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=Repository&amp;utm_campaign=9781786465153"><img src="https://d1ldz4te4covpm.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/5153_5666_R%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.png" alt="Learning Vulkan" height="256px" align="right"></a>

This is the code repository for [R Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/r-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Repository&utm_campaign=9781786465153), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (test expression)
{
  Statement upon condition is true
}
```

You will need a good understanding of R or another programming language. Preliminary experience of programming and data analysis will be helpful as well. You will need to appreciate algorithms that can be applied in scale to build applications.

Package in R can be installed using install.packages(“Package-name”)

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10)
